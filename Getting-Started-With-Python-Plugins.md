This tutorial is determined for developers which want to develop plugins for Jenkins in Python.
### How to start
1. First read the [Extend Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins) document. Everything there in the section _Developing Plugins_ applies also for the Python development.
2. Install latest JDK 7 and Maven tools. That is truly all you need for Python plugin development (with you favourite editor or IDE).
3. Look at the [existing Python plugins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.py/wiki/Existing-Python-Plugins) or generate a new plugin with the [PPSM tool](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.py/tree/master/ppsm) (you will need Python 3 for this).
4. Read the following sections.
